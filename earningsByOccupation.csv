IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING LFS EARNINGS ESTIMATES,,,,,,,,,,,
"The data on individual’s earnings captured by the LFS is thought to be of a lower quality than ASHE or AWE as LFS information is self-reported by employees. ASHE and AWE however, gather information from the employer which is thought to be more accurate as employers can consult payroll records. Individuals may not have such records to hand and their responses may therefore be subject to higher levels of recall error. Furthermore LFS responses can be given by proxy (by other individuals in the same household) when an individual is unavailable for interview. This gives further scope for recall error from respondents. Due to this recall error, estimates of earnings based on the LFS that are published by the ONS excluding those who earn more than £100 per hour as a quality assurance measure. These factors combined mean that gross weekly and hourly pay are known to be underestimated on the LFS.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Estimates of gross weekly and hourly earnings from the LFS are based upon 2/5 of the quarterly sample and are therefore subject to high sampling variability. For this reason, ONS recommends that any short term measurement of change be made with caution. ",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
1  Full-time is based on respondents' self assessment. The estimates relate to an individual's main job only.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
 The data for estimates prior to Jan-Mar 2011 were collected on the previous SOC basis (SOC 2000) and have been mapped to an equivalent SOC 2010 basis.,,,,,,,,,,,
 As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates before and after Jan-Mar 2011. ,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: As the estimates are not seasonally adjusted, it is best practice to only compare the same quarter for different years (e.g., compare January-March 2018 with January-March 2019 but do not compare July-September 2018 with January-March 2019).",,,,,,,,,,,
